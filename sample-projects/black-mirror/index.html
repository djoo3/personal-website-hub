            <h1>BLACK MIRROR IS A SHOW REVEALING THE TERRIFYING SIDE OF PUSHING TECHNOLOGY TOO FAR</h1>
            <p>&emsp;Black Mirror is a British TV show that is the brainchild of Charlie Brooker. While each episode is
                pretty much independent from one another (as they are also written and directed by different people), the
                underlying theme throughout the program is the bane of technology. Every episode takes place in a time somewhere
                between present world and not too far into the future, leaving a trace of familiarity in the technologies we
                observe in the show. Most episodes look at technology through a pessimistic lens, but a handful feature
                technology that is somewhat beneficial. Albeit, being Black Mirror, every episode will make you at least slightly
                uncomfortable.
                <br>&emsp;The name of the show itself comes from how a screen looks like a "black mirror" when it goes
                dark, as a symbolism for the darker side of technology. Some episodes, such as Nosedive (Season 3 Episode 1),
                or One Million Merits (Season 1 Episode 2) explore the subject of our digital image as people and how
                concerned we are about it. In that sense, Black Mirror has an almost prophetic vibe, or a fable of some sort that
                critiques our use of technology today. Another common subject covered in Black Mirror is the concept of digital
                threats, most prominently in The National Anthem (Season 1 Episode 1), Shut Up and Dance (Season 3 Episode 3),
                and Hated In the Nation (Season 3 Episode 6). Again, this is something that is already happening in our world
                today, with for example, hackers blackmailing people with public shaming for money. Not all episodes are a bleak and
                cynical view on technology, however, as episodes like San Junipero (Season 3 Episode 4) and Hang the DJ
                (Season 4 Episode 4) end on somewhat happy notes. Albeit it is safe to say the the general tone of the show is
                pessimistic, and sometimes downright horrifying, such as White Bear (Season 2 Episode 2), which features
                psycho killers in some perverted society, or Metalhead (Season 4 Episode 5), which gives a look into what the
                world may look like if artificial intelligence turned rogue against humans.
                <br>&emsp;Since the show is not chronologically ordered, you could jump in and start with whichever
                episode you'd like (I was introduced to Black Mirror with White Bear), but the last episode of Season 4 is kind of
                like an overarching episode covering a little bit of the plot points from each of the previous episode, so
                please start on anything but that one (The Black Museum [Season 4 Episode 6]). My personal favorites are White
                Christmas (Season 2 Episode 4), Hang the DJ (Season 4 Episode 4), Hated In the Nation (Season 3 Episode 6), and
                San Junipero (Season 3 Episode 4). Mind you, this show is not family friendly just in case you were
                wondering, and are not easy watches, in that it will require some thinking and analyzing on your part. So if you are
                not into either of those, this show may not be for you. Otherwise, happy binging! The future is brighter than
                ever.</p>
